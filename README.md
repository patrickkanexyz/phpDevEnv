# PHP Development Enviroment
This is a ready made PHP development enviroment. While in the root directory
run `docker-compose up -d` to start the server on the whatever port is
specified in the `docker-compose.yaml` file on line 8.

Then nginx server uses `/app/public` as the root directory.  That is where your
index.php/index.html file should be.  Expand the file tree from here.
